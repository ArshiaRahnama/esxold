-- Unique_LevelQuest — merged config (XP_Level_System + QuestSystem)
-- ================================================================= --
-- NOTE ON WHICH QUESTS ARE "ACTIVE":
-- The original QuestSystem/Config.lua listed ~50 quests (police, sheriff,
-- metropolitan, ambulance, mechanic, taxi, gang robberies, a full mining/
-- wool/wood/chicken "jobcenter" chain...) but almost none of those trigger
-- names were ever actually fired by any script on this server — they were
-- copy-pasted from a generic template. Firing a quest for an event that
-- never happens means the quest can NEVER be completed.
--
-- I went through the actual job/drug resources on this server
-- (esx_drugs, esx_organserver's ambulance/mechanic/taxi jobs, essentialmode
-- paycheck, esx_lscustom) and only kept/enabled quests that map to a REAL
-- event that already fires (see server/bridges.lua + client/bridges.lua).
-- Everything else is kept below but commented out, so you can re-enable
-- it later once you add the matching TriggerEvent/TriggerServerEvent call
-- at the right spot in the relevant script (or ask me to do it).

--[[ ============ NOT WIRED — no real event exists for these =========
    Checked every relevant resource on this server; none of these have
    an event that fires distinctly enough to track (or the resource
    doesn't exist at all). Left out rather than shipping a quest that
    can never complete. If you add/point me to a real trigger point
    for any of these, I'll wire it in:

      police/sheriff/metropolitan: Jail, Fine, Impound, Accept Robbery,
        Cuff — esx_jailhandler's jail flow doesn't fire a distinct
        server event for a completed jailing, and esx_aduty's "fine" is
        an ADMIN-only command (perm 3), not a police officer action.

      ambulance: Heal Player, Ghabz — esx_organserver fires
        esx_ambulancejob:heal on the PATIENT's client (not the medic's),
        and the fine-payment event is likewise fired by the patient
        paying, not the medic collecting — no reliable way to credit
        the right player without editing esx_organserver itself.

      mechanic: Repair, Clean, Flatbed, Impound, Flip, Custom Car —
        esx_lscustom's buyMod fires for ANY player buying mods for
        their own car (not job-gated to mechanics), so it can't be
        used to credit mechanics specifically. No other distinct event
        exists for these actions.

      taxi: Ghabz — esx_taxijob:pay is fired by the PASSENGER paying,
        not the driver receiving the fare, same attribution problem
        as ambulance Ghabz above.

      gang: shop/bank robbery quests — esx_shop_robbery /
        esx_Bank_robbery don't exist as resources anywhere on this
        server at all.

      petrol / wool / fabric / clothe / wood / chicken chain — no
        matching resource exists on this server under any name.
